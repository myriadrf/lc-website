CI Hardware Platform
====================

The continous integration hardware platform provides a combination of base stations and modem banks, with cabled RF and splitter/combiner network which features digitally controlled attenuation. The platform also includes support infrastructure such as clock distribution, interfacing and control.

The platform is modular in nature and housed in a 19" equipment rack.

Subsystems
----------

The CI platform is comprised of numerous subsystems and for details of these see the pages linked from the site menu. Links are provided for further details of COTS/third party components used, while details of original components developed as part of the project are hosted on this website.
