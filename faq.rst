Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Is this a fork or duplication of <insert project name>?
-------------------------------------------------------

No, the intention is to build upon existing projects, rather than to duplicate
efforts.

Why not simply contribute to an existing project?
-------------------------------------------------

A particular combination of hardware and functionality is being targeted, with
the objective of creating a complete hardware + software solution that is
relatively easy to set up and that is reliable. As such, it's possible that over
time some of the software components used may change. However, the intention
will also be to contribute back to upstream projects where possible.

Is it legal to operate a mobile phone network?
----------------------------------------------

Of course, provided that you have a spectrum licence. Cellular spectrum may be
licensed in the UK via `Ofcom Shared Access`_ and `CBRS`_ is available in the
US, for example. There are also other licensing schemes available elsewhere.
Further details will be provided in due course.
